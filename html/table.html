            In the Historical city Bhaktapur, 2016 Kartik 19 B.S. has been marked as one of the most important date in terms of an education. 
            The sole reason behind it was the establishment of Bhaktapur Multiple Campus which sparkled as the stepping stone of an education for the youngest city in Kathmandu Valley.
            As we all know that the establishment of an educational institution in Rana Regime was mostly just in the paper and it’s a bitter truth. 
            At that era, in Bhaktapur, there was just one school named Bhaktapur English School and one Sanskrit Pathshala and Kanya Pathshala as the learning center for an education. 
            Bhaktapur English School was later changed to Shri Padhma High School in 2003 B.S. 
            Mostly all the educational institutins used to be named after Rana Regime and Padhma High School was one among it. 
            It was said that, there was not a single graduate in Bhaktapur around 2003 B.S.From an ancient Era, Bhaktapur was mostly interested in Kalakaushal, 
            TantraMantra and Religion, because of that it couldn’t progress in an Education and may be it was because Bhaktapur was considered and given importance as agricultural hub among brother cities in Kathmandu Valley. 
            Business and Agriculture was the main specialization of Bhaktapur. Still then, there were a wise people interested in literature at era of Madhyakal. After 2003 B.S., Vidyarthi Niketan & Sharada School were established. After the fall of Rana Regime in 2007 B.S
